      <h2>small business</h2>
       <p class="text">   Small business startups are simple; they feature people who work for themselves instead of a traditional company that might employ someone in their profession. Examples include handymen, personal trainers, and boutique owners. These businesses arenâ€™t meant to make it big or change the world, they are intended to provide financial compensation to the owner. The business is the owners source of income.

      <h2>large business</h2>
       <p class="text">    Large businesses must continuously innovate due to the shifting environment. They are supposedly large-scale startups. These companies will have an infinite lifespan if they continue to innovate in response to new competition, changes in customer tastes and preferences, and technological advancement. They have the potential to become a driving force for more disruptive innovation. Google and Android are two such startups.

      <h2>Social startup </h2>
       <p class="text">  Social startups are the sixth type of startup. The purpose of social startups is not to create a sustainable business but to positively impact society and the economy. These startups aim to make the world a better place to live. They are less passionate and ambitious about earning profits when compared to other founders. In short, they provide donations, grants, and charities to build positive social and environmental change worldwide.
